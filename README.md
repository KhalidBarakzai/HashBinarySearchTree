# Hash_Binary_Search_Tree

Introduction.

This program utlizes a hash binary search tree to search for a key in about O(logn).

      
      This project uses many ideas including association lists, binary search trees, hashing, head nodes, and random numbers. You will have seen Java code for almost all parts of this project by now, either in the lectures or on Canvas. Much of your work will involve finding relevant parts of this code and adapting them.
